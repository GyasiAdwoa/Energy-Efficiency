    "Great! Let's start by loading the dataset and examining its structure to understand the data we're working with. This will help us perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on energy consumption.\n",

    "Here's a plan for the EDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading and Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the dataset and display the first few rows.\n",
    "Check the dimensions of the dataset.\n",
    "Get a summary of the dataset including data types and missing values.\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features.\n",
    "Analyze the distribution of numerical features using histograms and box plots.\n",
    "Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the correlation matrix.\n",
    "Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.\n",
    "Feature Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the relationship between different features and energy consumption.\n",
    "Use scatter plots and pair plots for visual analysis.\n",
    "Outlier Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify and visualize outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "Trend Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze trends in energy consumption over time if a time component is available.\n",
    "Summary and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize the findings from the EDA.\n",
    "Highlight any interesting patterns or insights.\n",
    "Let's start with loading the data and performing the initial inspection. I'll begin by reading the file and displaying the first few rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of the following columns:\n",

    "X1: Relative Compactness\n",

    "X4 (Roof Area): Exhibits a right-skewed distribution.\n",
    "X5 (Overall Height): Bimodal distribution, with two prominent peaks.\n",
    "X6 (Orientation): Discrete values with equal frequency (indicative of categorical data).\n",
    "X7 (Glazing Area): Left-skewed distribution, with many values concentrated at the lower end.\n",
    "X8 (Glazing Area Distribution): Discrete values with somewhat uniform distribution.\n",
    "Y1 (Heating Load): Right-skewed distribution with a few outliers.\n",
    "Y2 (Cooling Load): Right-skewed distribution with a few outliers.\n",
    "Next, let's analyze the correlation between these features using a correlation matrix and visualize it with a heatmap. This will help us understand the relationships between different features and identify any strong correlations with the target variables (Y1 and Y2). ​​\n",

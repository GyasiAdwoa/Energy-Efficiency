# Energy-Efficiency

Great! Let's start by loading the dataset and examining its structure to understand the data we're working with. This will help us perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on energy consumption.

Here's a plan for the EDA:

Data Loading and Inspection

Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
Check the dimensions of the dataset.
Get a summary of the dataset including data types and missing values.
Descriptive Statistics

Compute basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features.
Analyze the distribution of numerical features using histograms and box plots.
Correlation Analysis

Compute the correlation matrix.
Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
Feature Analysis

Analyze the relationship between different features and energy consumption.
Use scatter plots and pair plots for visual analysis.
Outlier Detection

Identify and visualize outliers in the dataset.
Trend Analysis

Analyze trends in energy consumption over time if a time component is available.
Summary and Insights

Summarize the findings from the EDA.
Highlight any interesting patterns or insights.
Let's start with loading the data and performing the initial inspection. I'll begin by reading the file and displaying the first few rows.

The dataset consists of the following columns:

X1: Relative Compactness
X2: Surface Area
X3: Wall Area
X4: Roof Area
X5: Overall Height
X6: Orientation
X7: Glazing Area
X8: Glazing Area Distribution
Y1: Heating Load
Y2: Cooling Load
Next, let's check the dimensions of the dataset, summary statistics, and data types for each column. We'll also check for any missing values. ​​

The dataset has 768 entries and 10 columns with no missing values. Here's a summary of the key statistics for each feature:

Numerical Features (X1 to X8, Y1, Y2):
X1 (Relative Compactness): Mean = 0.764, Std = 0.106
X2 (Surface Area): Mean = 671.708, Std = 88.086
X3 (Wall Area): Mean = 318.500, Std = 43.626
X4 (Roof Area): Mean = 176.604, Std = 45.166
X5 (Overall Height): Mean = 5.250, Std = 1.751
X6 (Orientation): Mean = 3.500, Std = 1.119
X7 (Glazing Area): Mean = 0.234, Std = 0.133
X8 (Glazing Area Distribution): Mean = 2.813, Std = 1.551
Y1 (Heating Load): Mean = 22.307, Std = 10.090
Y2 (Cooling Load): Mean = 24.588, Std = 9.513
Next, we'll visualize the distribution of each numerical feature using histograms and box plots to get a better understanding of their distributions and identify any potential outliers. ​​


The histograms and box plots provide insights into the distribution of each numerical feature. Here's a summary of the observations:

X1 (Relative Compactness): Appears to have a slightly left-skewed distribution.
X2 (Surface Area): Shows a nearly normal distribution.
X3 (Wall Area): Displays a somewhat uniform distribution with a slight peak around the mean.
X4 (Roof Area): Exhibits a right-skewed distribution.
X5 (Overall Height): Bimodal distribution, with two prominent peaks.
X6 (Orientation): Discrete values with equal frequency (indicative of categorical data).
X7 (Glazing Area): Left-skewed distribution, with many values concentrated at the lower end.
X8 (Glazing Area Distribution): Discrete values with somewhat uniform distribution.
Y1 (Heating Load): Right-skewed distribution with a few outliers.
Y2 (Cooling Load): Right-skewed distribution with a few outliers.
Next, let's analyze the correlation between these features using a correlation matrix and visualize it with a heatmap. This will help us understand the relationships between different features and identify any strong correlations with the target variables (Y1 and Y2). ​​

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

For now, you can proceed by computing the correlation matrix and visualizing it using a heatmap with the following code:

python
Copy code
# Compute the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = energy_data.corr()

# Plot the correlation matrix using a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
